## How to apply the PMDA & CDISC Define validation criteria to validate Define.xml (version 1.0, 2.0, 2.1)? 

1) Use a programme that can validate Define.xml. Such tools are readily available, such saÂ [eDataValidator](https://pointcrosslifesciences.com/edatavalidator/).
2) Enter the validation tool with your Define.xml file.
3) Choose one of the three Define.xml versions (1.0, 2.0, or 2.1) for the validation tool.
4) Apply the Define.xml file's validation rules from the PMDA and CDISC.
5) Go over the validation report the tool produced to find any issues or warnings that need to be fixed.
6) Make the necessary changes to the Define.xml file to address any issues or warnings found in the validation report.
7) Verify again that all problems and warnings have been fixed in the Define.xml file.
8) Up until the Define.xml file passes each validation check, repeat the validation and repair process.
